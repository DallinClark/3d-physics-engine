# 3D Physics Engine 

**Overview**

This is a 3D physics engine designed for simulating real-time rigid body dynamics, written in C++ and rendered with OpenGL. 

**Features**

Rigid Body Dynamics: Simulates 3D objects with mass, velocity, and rotational movement.

Collision Detection: Supports Sphere and Polygon collision detection.

Collision Resolution: Implements impulse-based resolution for realistic responses.

Forces and Constraints: Supports gravity, friction, restitution, and basic constraints.

Broad-phase and Narrow-phase Detection: Optimized for efficiency.
